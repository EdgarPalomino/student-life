Project Name: Student Life

Project Description: A small website that I created to host my sound piece "Student Life" (which I made with my classmates Rasa Korsakaite, Isha Gandham and Hamad Al Shamsi). The overall concept of the website involves having a web page that takes the point of view of an NYU Abu Dhabi student and the user can then "lead them" throughout their day, starting from the moment they wake up to the moment they go to sleep. The overall theme of the website is based around the different locations and situations that NYUAD students encounter everyday, as these help create the setting and atmosphere for the sound piece. In general, I tried my best to create an interactive experience for the visitors of my "Student Life" website.

Process: In order to implement my overall concept for the website, I used SVGs to add a clickable part to Rasa's drawings. While the user is playing an audio from the sound piece, the SVG shows its top layer (which is an uncolored version of Rasa's drawings). But when the audio finishes playing, this layer slowly disappears (with an animation to make it fade-out) and the SVG now shows a layer that has an object (such as an alarm clock or a football) colored in red. At the same time, the message at the bottom right corner of the web page changes its text (with animations to make the message fade-out and fade-in) to now tell the user which object in the drawing they should click to "continue" the student's day. After the user does this, the web page shows the drawing and emoji for the next moment of the student's day (with animations to make the web page fade-out and fade-in). Also, when the user clicks the object in the last drawing, the page refreshes to "restart" the student's day. Apart from this, there are "play", "pause" and "replay" buttons which the user can use to play the audios of the sound piece.

Reflection/Evaluation: In general, I would say that my website did not vary a lot from its initial concept to its final implementation. For example, when I first joined my classmates for this project, they already had the idea of creating a sound piece that would try to portray a normal day for an NYUAD student, along with drawings and emojis that would match each moment of the student's day. However, the small changes that I made to our initial concept were mostly to add more interactivity to the web page and also make the navigation more intuitive for the user. For example, I added the "play", "pause" and "replay" buttons to allow the user to interact more with the audios, and I also added the messages that tell the user which object they should click to "continue" the student's day to help them navigate the website more easily. But in the end, I am happy and proud that me and my classmates could fulfill the final vision that we had for our website and that we could create an immersive and entertaining sound piece.
